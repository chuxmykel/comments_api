## Motivation üí°

[The Clean Architecture By Robert C. Martin](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

Maintainability has been an issue for me lately and I am trying to understand how to build cleaner, testable and more robust apps.

## Technologies ‚öô

- [deno](https://deno.land/) - A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- [oak](https://deno.land/x/oak) - A middleware framework for Deno's http server, including a router middleware.
- [deno-postgres](https://deno.land/x/postgres) - A PostgreSQL driver for Deno.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To run this applicaton, [deno](https://deno.land/) must be installed.

Run `which deno` to confirm that you have deno installed. You should get the directory of the installed deno binary printed to your console if you have deno installed correctly.

Run `deno run -A src/mod.ts` to start up the server.
The `-A` flag allows all permissions and may be insecure. Review the permissions and enable individually if you have any security concerns.
